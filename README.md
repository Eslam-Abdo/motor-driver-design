# Motor Driver Design
This repository contains the latest version of my motor driver design project. My role in the project included reverse engineering a Cytron 10-A motor driver, redesigning the driver circuit using Eagle PCB tool, and designing multiple versions to improve the design.

## Latest Version
Below is a picture of the latest version of the motor driver circuit board:
